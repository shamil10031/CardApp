                        airlifts in California, police say.\n\n
                        As young people pursue the perfect selfie or video for their social media pages, the Los Angeles CountySheriff\'s Department says it is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars plucking the injured and
                        stranded from beauty spot locations. "People have to understand: people die up in those mountains.
                        For every rescue you see that we do, there are ones that we don't make. They're dead," said Deputy
                        Stephen Doucette.\n\n
                        A social media search for locations like Eaton Canyon, Hermit Falls and Malibu Creek Rock Pool reveal
                        dozens of risky selfie videos. Two men were recently rescued after being injured while being filmed at
                        Hermit Falls.</string>
